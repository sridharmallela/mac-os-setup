- [Click here](setup/readme.md)  for more detailed setup instructions.
- [Click here](sync/readme.md)  for more detailed sync instructions.

## Terminal

- Open terminal and `Terminal > Preferences > Profiles`, click on setting icon and select `import` this file is `$HOME/git/setup-macbook/copyfiles/terminal/custom_terminal.terminal` and mark it as default.
- Why do I not see any icons (glyphs) or why do I see question mark boxes [?] ?
  - Make sure you are using a font that has the powerline symbols
  - Make sure your terminal encoding is set to UTF-8
    - `echo $LANG` should give something like `en_US.UTF-8`
