#  flex - a prompt with nearly everything ...
#    - user set-able colours and date format
#    - load display (loads above one only, displayed in
#      the upper right corner)
#    - history number, directory, username, hostname
#    - terminal number and clock in the upper right corner
#    - if you're in "screen," it will let you know
#    - if you have apm, the status of your battery will be
#      displayed
#    - the info in the upper right corner can be set to
#      auto-refresh

# Look past the colour list to set your own prompt colours and options

#  Notes:
#  ------
#  - to clean up previous autorefreshes:
#       jobs -l | grep callPrintInfo | awk '{print $2}'
#  - could make a lot of stuff user settable as variables,
#    like date format (done) ...
#  - evidently CHANGING LINES in a tput cursor relocate
#    is BAD - this is why I have two separate functions
#    setting up the two lines of the upper right corner.
#    Without this, long command lines are butchered.
